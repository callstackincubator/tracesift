/**
 * Zooming a chart that is laid out in percentages.
 *
 * Both charts in Explore place everything they draw as a share of one element:
 * the timeline's boxes are percentages of the task's duration, the flame
 * graph's frames percentages of the subtree's time. So neither needs a
 * measured layout to fit, and neither needs one to zoom either — widening that
 * element past its scrolling parent is the whole of it, and every box inside
 * follows for free.
 *
 * That is also why a gesture here writes to the DOM rather than to state. A
 * wheel fires far faster than a chart of a thousand boxes can re-render, and
 * the one thing a zoom control must do is keep up with the hand. React hears
 * about the zoom once the gesture settles, which is when the things that
 * genuinely need a render — the timeline's ruler, the flame graph's floors on
 * what is drawn and what is labelled — catch up.
